The big picture is for the App to allow a friend to recommend me a movie by using a search bar and adding the movie to my "recomended list". the movie should be indicated if its already on the list or if I have watched it before.

\*\*If complexity allows, it will be improved to allow multi users; initially it is movie recomendatin for one user only.

---------Current capabilities-------------

- search movie.
- Add to watched/seen.
- Remove movie.
- In Local storage persistance

---------future updates to work on------------

- UI improvement (Responsiveness).
- Database persistance.
- Login (using google/github/facebook)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
